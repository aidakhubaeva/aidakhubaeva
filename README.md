# ðŸ‘‹ Hello everyone!

## About Me
I am a Frontend Developer who approaches tasks with creativity and enthusiasm. I always have plenty of ideas, and if one doesnâ€™t work, Iâ€™m ready to propose another. I truly enjoy the process of finding solutions, discussing, and refining ideas. For me, itâ€™s important to work on projects with a strong concept and aesthetic value, as I want not only to create something meaningful but also to find innovative and unconventional approaches.

Iâ€™m passionate about technology, analytics, and structure - they inspire me to dive deep into tasks.  
In work, I value teams where communication and management structures allow professional growth.

My experience includes writing clean and efficient code, organizing workflows, and prioritizing tasks effectively.  
Choosing a profession in this field was a conscious decision for me, and I am ready to invest my energy and effort to become a true professional.

Currently, I am working on two personal projects:
1. A digital coloring book store  
2. A social network for travelers  
   I believe that existing solutions either donâ€™t address all user needs or have too complex and inconvenient interfaces.

## Hobbies
- Restoring cars: I enjoy bringing classic vehicles back to life by combining creativity with precision.  
- Diving and bird photography: Capturing the beauty of nature both above and below water.  
- Creating bird-themed coloring books: Designing and illustrating unique books to inspire creativity in others.  
- Hiking and archery: Exploring the mountains and improving my skills with a bow.  
- Tinkering and repair: I love understanding how things work â€” from mechanics to clothing â€” and figuring out how to create, fix, or improve them.
