# ðŸ‘‹ Hello everyone!

## About Me
I'm a front-end developer who approaches tasks with creativity and enthusiasm. I always have plenty of ideas, and if one doesnâ€™t work, Iâ€™m ready to suggest another. 
I really enjoy the process of finding solutions, discussing, and refining ideas. Itâ€™s important for me to work on projects with a strong concept and aesthetic value because
My goal is not only to create something meaningful but also to find new, unconventional approaches.

I love design, technology, and structure, which is why I chose front-end development. It allows me to combine creativity with analytical work. 
I'm inspired by creating intuitive and aesthetically pleasing user interfaces. I find working with animations and complex visual elements particularly interesting.
It's valuable for me to be a part of the team where communication and management help team members grow.

My experience includes not only writing clean and efficient code but also organizing workflows and prioritizing my tasks. 
Choosing this profession was a deliberate decision for me, and I am ready to invest time and energy into my professional growth.

Currently, I am working on two personal projects:
1. A digital coloring book store  
2. A social network for travelers  
   I believe that existing solutions either donâ€™t address all user needs or have too complex and inconvenient interfaces.

## Hobbies
- Restoring cars: I enjoy bringing classic vehicles back to life by combining creativity with precision.  
- Diving and bird photography: Capturing the beauty of nature both above and below water.  
- Creating bird-themed coloring books: Designing and illustrating unique books to inspire creativity in others.  
- Hiking and archery: Exploring the mountains and improving my skills with a bow.  
- Tinkering and repair: I love understanding how things work - from mechanics to clothing - and figuring out how to create, fix, or improve them.
